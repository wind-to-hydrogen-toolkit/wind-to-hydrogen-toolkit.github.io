# Wind-to-Hydrogen Toolkit

[Wind-to-Hydrogen Toolkit](https://github.com/wind-to-hydrogen-toolkit) is a collection of tools developed by researchers in the H-Wind and HyFloat1 projects at the [MaREI Centre](https://www.marei.ie/), [University College Cork (UCC)](https://www.ucc.ie/en/) to study the integration of offshore wind with the production, storage, and utilisation of hydrogen.

We expect that these tools will be of benefit to project developers, students, and other researchers to work on green hydrogen systems.
As work is peer reviewed, we will release these tools for public use as a durable output of the H-Wind and HyFloat1 projects.

## H-Wind: Hydrogen from offshore wind

[H-Wind](https://www.marei.ie/project/h-wind/) is a MaREI Centre industry-led collaborative research project on the production of green hydrogen from offshore wind farms.
Thanks to Ireland having one of the world's best offshore wind resources, there is an extensive opportunity for green hydrogen to be generated through electrolysis from offshore wind farms in Ireland.

This three-year, multi-disciplinary project focusses on:

- Utilising green hydrogen as the interface between offshore wind energy, gas networks, electricity system, and markets, and to develop new markets for zero-carbon green hydrogen.
- Assisting Ireland in ensuring the delivery of the EU strategy on energy system integration, and to also help with the government's 2050 targets.
- Suitable hydrogen hubs for the Irish, Celtic, and Atlantic Seas, which are necessary to meet the goal of this large-scale hydrogen production from offshore wind farms, along with hydrogen storage and transportation.
- The customer value chain, policy recommendations, hydrogen safety and procedures, and concepts for scalable and optimised offshore wind.

All of these factors will contribute to significantly replacing Ireland's reliability on fossil fuels which will effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions, along with securing the national energy supply and enabling the exploration of new energy export markets.

The H-Wind project was supported by a research grant from [Science Foundation Ireland (SFI)](https://www.sfi.ie/) under Grant No. 12/RC/2302 – P2 and by the industry consortium members: [DP Energy](https://dpenergy.com/), [Equinor](https://www.equinor.com/), [ESB](https://esb.ie/), and [Gas Networks Ireland](https://www.gasnetworks.ie/).

## HyFloat1: Concept development of floating offshore wind foundations coupled with hydrogen storage

Hydrogen produced from floating offshore wind energy will require innovative storage systems.
The [HyFloat1](https://www.seai.ie/data-and-insights/seai-research/research-database/research-projects/details/hyfloat1:-concept-development-of-floating-offshore-wind-foundations-coupled-with-hydrogen-storage) project aims at developing new concepts for floating offshore wind foundations coupled with hydrogen storage.
Several existing floating offshore wind foundations will be numerically assessed and modified for storing hydrogen.
Converting offshore wind energy into hydrogen and storing it in the foundations of a floating offshore wind turbine is a novel approach that could reduce the levelised cost of energy for floating wind.

The HyFloat1 project was supported by a research grant from the [Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI)](https://www.seai.ie).
